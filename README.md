Starter template for transferring JSON data over TCP.

## Getting Started
*Transmission Control Protocol* (TCP) is one of the main protocols in the transport layer of the internet protocol (IP). Unlike UDP, TCP does not preserve message boundaries. One solution is to use a **common message format** such as:

![Proposed TCP message format](img/proposed-tcp-message-format.png)

## Installation
Download *cJSON.x* and *tcp_cJSON.x* directly, or clone this repository. Then, import *tcp_cJSON.h* into your project.
```c
#include <./tcp_cJSON.h>
```

## Usage
A simple example on how to use tcp_cJSON can be found [here](./examples). 

For a more complicated example, refer to this [project](https://github.com/Jordan396/trivial-twitter-v2).

Refer to this [link](https://github.com/DaveGamble/cJSON) for instructions on how to use cJSON.
